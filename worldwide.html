	<p>Ooh<br />
	Wait a minute before you tell me anything how was your day?<br />
	Cause I been missing you by my side,yeah<br />
	Did I awake you out of your dream<br />
	I'm sorry but I couldn't sleep<br />
	You calm me down<br />
	There's something bout the sound of your voice<br />
	I-I-I-I'm never never(never as far away as it may seem)<br />
	Soon we'll be together<br />
	We'll pick up right where we left off<br />
	Paris,London,Tokyo<br />
	So hey, let's be friends<br />
	There's just one thing that I gotta do<br />
	(Hello , tuck you in every night on the phone)<br />
	and I could hardly take another goodbye</p>
