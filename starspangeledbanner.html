		<p>Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light</br>
	</br>What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?</br>
</br>Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,</br>
	</br>O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?</br>
</br>And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,</br>
	</br>Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.</br>
</br>Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave</br>
	</br>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</br>
</br>On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,</br>
	</br>Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,</br>
</br>What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,</br>
	</br>As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?</br>
</br>Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,</br>
	</br>In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:</br>
</br>'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave</br>
	</br>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</br>

</br>That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,</br>
	</br>A home and a country should leave us no more!</br>
</br>Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.</br>
	</br>No refuge could save the hireling and slave</br>
</br>From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave</br>
	</br>And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave</br>
</br>O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</br>
	</br>Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand</br>
</br>Between their loved home and the war's desolation!</br>
	</br>Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land</br>
</br>Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.</br>
	</br>Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,</br>
</br>And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!</br>
